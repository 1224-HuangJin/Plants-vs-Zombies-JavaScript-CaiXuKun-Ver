*New Plants vs. Zombies JavaScript* is an open-source PvZ fan-made game produced by [JiangNanGame](http://www.jiangnangame.com).

It's the most early PvZ fan-made game of JiangNanGame, developed from 2015 to 2016. **So there are many bugs in this game.**

If you are common player, who want to play this project, we hope you can **give up it**, and turn to our latest PvZ fan-made game *[Plants vs. Zombies Travel](https://angel-shadow.itch.io/pvz-travel)*, which will bring you the best game experience.

If you are programmer, who want to learn how to develop a web game through this project, we hope you can **give up it**, and turn to our latest open-source PvZ fan-made game *The Open Source Version Of PvZ Travel*, which has less bugs and more programming-compliant code.
