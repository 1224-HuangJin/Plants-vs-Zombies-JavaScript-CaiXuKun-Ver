# New Plants vs. Zombies JavaScript

*New Plants vs. Zombies JavaScript* is an open-source PvZ fan-made game produced by [JiangNanGame](http://www.jiangnangame.com).

It's the most early PvZ fan-made game of JiangNanGame, developed from 2015 to 2016. So there are many bugs in this game.

If you are common player, who want to play this project, we hope you can give up it, and turn to our latest PvZ fan-made game *Plants vs. Zombies Travel*, which will bring you the best game experience.

If you are programmer, who want to learn how to develop a web game through this project, we hope you can give up it, and turn to our latest open-source PvZ fan-made game *The Open Source Version Of PvZ Travel*, which has less bugs and more programming-compliant code.
